Portfolio with my resume

Wanted to design a webpage with my Portfolio so I can update it as I go with my projects, resume (not up to date) and contact information.

I spent a while mocking up an idea on excalidraw to get as close as I could to what I wanted the website to look like.

I built this because I want to practice building webpages with content and make it useful on all platforms.

I learned a lot building this page, first just how to layout the HTML, 3 hours later it changed a few times to look better so it makes sense. Working on the CSS is what took the most time styling the page to look more user friendly. Spent many hours because I'm still not getting it well enough to just do it, lot of selecting different flex-box values and getting it to work. I'm sure my code has too many things but once I learn more I can update and refactor later.

I looked at a few examples of portfolios that were finished, and used a screentshot of the mockup. I googled a lot to see how to flexbox, color schemes and background images work. Also used mdn and w3schools a lot to find gradient, hover and grid-template-rows.

Deployed this to Github pages so I could see the live website working. This is the link to the project.

I went to https://digitalsynopsis.com/design/beautiful-color-palettes-combinations-schemes/ to get some good color palettes for the layout of the webpage.

I used https://www.pexels.com/ and the "Hero" image credit to Tiago Carduso. The project background images credits to Hitesh Cloudhary, Pixaby, Soumil Kumar and Oliver Sjostrom.
W3Schools for the grid-layout portion. I used MDN a lot for reference when doing the CSS portion.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:
![alt text](./images/screenshot.png)

This project was challenging to me but I really appreciated all the help the TA's offered as well as classmates.

I used a MIT license for this project.
