Portfolio with my resume

Wanted to design a webpage with my Portfolio so I can update it as I go with my projects, resume and contact information.

I built this page because I want to practice building webpages with content and make it useful on all platforms.

I learned a lot building this page, first just how to layout the HTML so it makes sense. Working on the CSS is what took the most time styling the page to look more user friendly.

I looked at a few examples of projects that were finished and started from there. I googled a lot to see how to flexbox, color schemes and background images work.

Deployed this to Github pages so I could see the live website working.
I went to https://digitalsynopsis.com/design/beautiful-color-palettes-combinations-schemes/ to get some good color palettes for the layout of the webpage.
I used https://www.pexels.com/ and the "Hero" image credit to Tiago Carduso. The project background images credits to Hitesh Cloudhary, Pixaby, Soumil Kumar and Oliver Sjostrom.
W3Schools for the grid-layout portion. I used MDN a lot for reference when doing the CSS portion.
I used a MIT license for this project.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
